# A Delivery Robot Built With C and EV3


This project code highlights my group's final MTE121 Course Project and shows how a P Loop was implemented as well as detection software to guide the robot to its destination. It is a battery and snakc delivery autonomous robot that can navigate towards a certain location in a pre-determined building to deliver orders based on user input. It was mechanically engineered with a custom chasis and was built to optmizie it's movement with all the weight of the chasis, sensors, and the holding compartment. The software was developed with mechanical restrictions in mind and was repeteadly tested to make sure the P loop constants were optimized. Includes drivers for the ultrasonic and color sensors as well as dc motors.
